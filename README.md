This is the code repository for the method developed in Schneider et al. (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c04042) to determine wildfire influence from air quality data. 

This repository includes the R package needed to run the method, as well as the following data which can be used to apply the method: 

- MODIS data from 2000-2021 for Canada and the US
- NAPS Station information 

Currently, there is all the information that you would need to run the model for Canada from 2000-2021, pending NAPS air quality data availability which currently (as of March 2022) only has continuous data until 2019.
